    <h1 className="Art-Title">What is Art Therapy</h1>

    <p className="Art-para">Art Therapy is a therapeutic modality that uses the creative process of art making as a vehicle to improvement in ones physical, emotional, spiritual, and mental health. The process of creating art and reflecting on themes and metaphors with the help of the art therapist can bring forth inner thoughts and feelings that may otherwise be difficult to articulate in words.

    You do not have to be an artist to benefit from art therapy. In art therapy the emphasis is based on the process and self-expression, not the final product. Art therapy also aligns with the belief that everyone is innately creative.
