    <h1>MEET THE ART THERAPIST</h1>
    <p>My name is Tayler Schenkeveld. I am a MÃ©tis woman and professionally trained Art Therapist practicing in Calgary, AB. In 2015, I completed my Bachelor of Arts with a major in Native Studies. I then carried on to receive a masters-level diploma from the Kutenai Art Therapy Institute. It was there that I developed my unique approach to art therapy. I work from an Indigenous and relational lens, often integrating traditional healing ways and art forms into the sessions, such as using storytelling, beadwork, smudging, and even attending ceremony with my clients. I strive to create safe and sacred space for all peoples to heal and grow.</p>
